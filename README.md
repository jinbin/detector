### mini programs

WeChat mini programs are sub-applications within the WeChat app which require no download, no install. They are fast, and can usually be developed quickly at a lower cost. It is considered they can do 80% of what native apps are doing, with only 20% of the development efforts!

They have several touchpoints that make them easily discoverable and very sticky. They can be shared within an article or a group chat and will generate a visually appealing thumbnail. 

Mini programs are very young tech ecosystem: just 2 years old. However, given China scale and China speed, its 1.5M developer’s community already gave birth to useful front-end frameworks for additional productivity. 

### WePy

WePy is one of the best frameworks for mini programs. This framework is officially supported by Tencent. WePy (say “Wepee”) is the pioneer of its kind as it appeared back in 2016… during WeChat MP’s beta release. From then on, hundreds of active contributors and a very vibrant community through Github/WeChat groups helped to shape it to a robust toolkit.

Drawbacks: Very little to say! WePy is easy to pick up and relevant with all modern workflows.

Overall WePy leads to better code: reusability, maintainability, performance… Many believe this solution brings productivity and better products!
